# Dual Rasterizer

This is a hybrid C++ implementation of the rasterizer module. It offers its user the option to switch between a Hardware rendering implementation and a Software one in real-time - the first using DirectX and the second having been built using the SDL library.

This application supports multiple scenes, moving cameras, transparency, cull-mode and sampler-filter switching, and a single customizable directional light.
